## Description

The SongLibrary is a Java library that contains songs of different genres. Users can create playlists and manage their favorite songs using this platform. The library's core functionality is implemented using three main classes:

1. **SongLibrary**: The central class that keeps track of all users. It contains an ArrayList of User objects.

2. **User**: Represents a user of the library. Each User object contains the user's username and an ArrayList of their playlists.

3. **Playlist**: Represents a playlist created by a user. Each Playlist object contains the playlist title and an ArrayList of Songs.

4. **Song**: Represents a song with its name, artist name, and duration, all stored as Strings. The Song class also provides getter methods for these attributes.

1. Create and manage user accounts.
2. Create and manage playlists with various songs.
