## Description

The SongLibrary is a Java library that contains songs of different genres. Users can create playlists and manage their favorite songs using this platform. The library's core functionality is implemented using three main classes:

1. **SongLibrary**: The central class that keeps track of all users. It contains an ArrayList of User objects.

2. **User**: Represents a user of the library. Each User object contains the user's username and an ArrayList of their playlists.

3. **Playlist**: Represents a playlist created by a user. Each Playlist object contains the playlist title and an ArrayList of Songs.

4. **Song**: Represents a song with its name, artist name, and duration, all stored as Strings. The Song class also provides getter methods for these attributes.

## Features

The SongLibrary management system offers the following features:

1. Create and manage user accounts.
2. Create and manage playlists with various songs.
